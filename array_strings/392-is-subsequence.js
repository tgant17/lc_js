// *********************************************************************************************************** */
// Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

// A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by 
// deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. 
// (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

// APPROACH
// Two pointers. Tried using a extra loop at first but then changed it and 
// did it in one


// Time Complexity
// o(n)
// Space Complexity
// o(1)
